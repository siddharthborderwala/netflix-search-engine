# IR Project

Information Retrieval from Semi-Structured Data

## Abstract

In this project, I have created an IR system for semi-structured data, in this case CSV (comma separated values) data. The data-set contains 8807 records of shows on [Netflix](https://netflix.com) - including the show name, director's name, cast, date of release, length/duration, genre and the plot.

The aim is to build a search engine for netflix shows, based on topics learnt throughout the information retrieval course and some concepts of natural language processing.
